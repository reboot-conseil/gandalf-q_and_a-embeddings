# Open AI API's course (Reboot Academy) POC

## Objective

- Try out OpenAI's embeddings to benchmark how we could create a Q&A bot.

## Who

- Yacine

## Did we reach the goal ?

Yes, although we use Azure Cognitive Search for our in-house bot. We know now that we can set embeddings for any knowledge base to create a Q&A bot.

## Conclusion

- Building embeddings is a good way to create a Q&A bot because it's easy
- It might be cheaper that summarizing content in a prompt to send to the API
- It also might be faster because we would have less communication with external systems, such as APIs
- We still need to know exactly in what kind of a database we would store our embeddings
